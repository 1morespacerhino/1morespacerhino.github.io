title: Astral Adventures

One traditional view of the Astral Plane describes it as having the debris of dead or decaying deities. So here's an idea for a side adventure:

A lone remaining priestess of a long lost power lures na√Øve prime material plane denizens to her decaying deities location---either by means of magic, psionics, or her own growing powers-of-thought. Little do the characters know that this lone priestess has been gathering "believers" by means of brainwashing. The characters may arrive at the the location of the decaying deity thinking they've discovered a refugee camp---poor lost souls stuck in the Astral. Drop clues that things aren't as they appear. The priestess needs the characters connection to their prime material plane to power the belief necessary to finally resuscitate her patron. The characters will have to decide whether and how they will stop her, and then what to do with the newly freed "believers."
