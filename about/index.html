  <div class="about">

    <p>The website design for 1morespacerhino.github.io is borrowed from <a href="http://www.jmcglone.com">jmcglone.com</a>, whose <a href="http://jmcglone.com/guides/github-pages/">guide</a> to <a href="https://pages.github.com/">GitHub Pages</a> is exceptionally clear and helpful. Thank you, Jonathan.</p>

    <p>Since I write about roleplaying games, I sometimes write about <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>, <em>Planescape</em>, <em>Forgotten Realms</em>, etc.; this intellectual property is &copy; 2016 Wizards of the Coast.</p>
