title: Fifth Edition Unther

*The following is a draft of the story of the* Forgotten Realms *region Unther and the story of its god-king Gilgeam. I have always found Unther and its Assyrian/Babylonian flavor a fresh break from your typical sword and sorcery campaign region. Adding the extraplanar exile only makes for a more interesting place.*

##Unther Returned

Unther is a realm unstuck in time, a realm out of place, a realm that belongs unwaveringly to its eternal god-king.

Unther’s recent history is tumultuous and otherworldly. For a time, Unther was in an elsewhere transported by powerful magicks to another world, a dark place where the Untherites lost themselves. Those who lived in exile suffered, and few speak of it. They have returned now under the leadership of their reincarnated god-king Gilgeam, who aspires to return Unther to its former glory.

###Empire and Exile

The founding of Unther occurred over three and a half millennia ago on the far southeastern coast of the Inner Sea (The Sea of Fallen Stars), alongside its rival and sister nation Mulhorand. Both the Mulhorandi and Untherites belong to the same ethnic group, the Mulan, and share a history as slaves to the Imaskari, an ancient race of wizards, whose empire is now forgotten or lost to the depths of the Underdark [1]. Only with the aid of their gods incarnate were the Mulhorandi and Untherites able to escape their bondage, after which they warred against each other for supremacy in eastern Faerûn.

Over its millennia of history, most of the incarnations of the Untheric gods were either slain in battle or departed to distant planes, save for Gilgeam, the god-king and sovereign of Unther, and his nemesis the Dragon Queen of Chaos and Change, Tiamat.

Gilgeam, The Father of Victory, ruled with honor and justice for centuries. In time, however, he grew vain, despotic, and wicked. His priests oppressed the Untheric people and the nation festered and diminished. After the Time of Troubles, Gilgeam was punished for his cruelty, but his arrogance prevented the recognition of his own weakness. Lured into battle by the cunning of Tiamat, she devoured him.

Without Gilgeam the ruling theocracy crumbled and the Mulhorandi crossed the River of Swords, the traditional border between the nations, and swiftly seized its lands. But this was not the end of the Untherites’ suffering. About one century ago, during a cataclysm known as the Spellplague, Unther and its people were torn from Toril and displaced into another dimension of existence, where they suffered under cruel otherworldly masters. No one was spared---Untheric nobles, fallen priests, serfs and slaves, all suffered in this one-hundred-year exile.

They suffered until one man calling himself Gilgeam rose to power. The reborn god-king united his broken people and just as they prepared the decisive battle to throw off the rule of their masters, they were transported to Toril in an event celebrated among Untherites as the Return. Under Gilgeam’s command the Untherites reclaimed much of their ancestral homelands, which were occupied by a magically displaced dragonborn nation Tymanther. The Untherites hold the Tymantherites responsible for their exile. Their draconic features only confirms Untherite suspicions that the dragonborn of Tymanther are the source and cause of their century of exile.

###Patience and the Law

After the reconquest of Unther, Gilgeam ruled over the realm with remarkable restraint and prudence. The capital of New Unthalass was swiftly built over the ruins of the Tymantherite city Djerad Thymar, near the foothills of the Smoking Mountains and the new Green Delta, a fertile stretch of land that formed when the Ash and Lance Lakes drained. During his early reign, Gilgeam instituted a program of public works that gave all citizens opportunities for steady and secure employment. Numerous statues, temples, and monotholic architecture memorialize the reconquest and depict Gilgeam, his priests, and followers in majestic images of piety and justice.

As time passed, however, the reincarnated Gilgeam remembered his centuries old decline into wickedness, and with wise forethought he retired to his palace, the House of Patience, at the center of New Unthalass. Before his withdrawal from active rule, he handed down the Law, which was inscribed onto an obelisk in the capital. These laws apply equally to all citizens and enshrine the virtues of courage, temperance, justice, and piety. Gilgeam also anointed seventy priestly judges to rule over the city’s and nation’s affairs with instructions only to consult him on grave matters. The High Priest who leads the judges has on very rare occasion sought the advice of the god-king, but these interventions are few and infrequent.

###Recent Happenings

Citizens of Unther reflect their god-king’s new disposition---patient, prudent, and pious but likewise also ambitious, hard-hearted, and strict adherents of the Law. They recognize that life is a hardship and that each must embrace her own fate, whatever it may be. Following the Law is crucial in Unther; without it tyranny, ruin, and exile may once again befall the nation. To that end the Judges offer a strict, literal, and sometimes cold interpretation of the Law, and their decisions are enforced by a zealous cadre of paladins called the Exemplars, whose aim and life’s aspiration is to emulate their god-king in justice, piety, and obedience [2]. Among the Judges are not only warriors and priests but also several warlocks who have tied their lives’ essences to the undying god-king’s [3].

Not all are appeased by the reformed Gilgeam and new Unther. Among the Judges some belong to a secret organization, the members of which call themselves the Elders. The Elders trace their ancestry to the pre-exile Untherite nobility and priesthood. They long for the rewards and privileges their patient loyalty has earned. They secretly work against the other Judges and the Exemplars and aim to fill one-by-one the ranks of the Judges with their own members.

Growing in popularity is also a prophetess of Tiamat. She claims that the Return was not the doing of Gilgeam but of the Dragon Queen and the work of her disciples in the Cult of the Dragon. If the people of Unther truly want reform, they must work towards the Cult’s ends and rid themselves of the Gilgeam’s rule once more.

Clerics of Gilgeam may use the following deity description. He is the sole member of the Untheric Pantheon. His favored weapon is the heavy mace; use the warhammer description on the Weapons table [4].
