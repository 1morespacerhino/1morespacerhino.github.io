title: Planewalker Background
---

*Here is a draft of a planewalker background I've designed for D&D 5e.*

**Planewalker**

You travel the great wheel of the multiverse, and you have learned a lot in your travels. You may be from the Outlands, Sigil, or another prime material world. You travel the planes either by choice or by chance. Work with your Dungeon Master to decide the breadth and depth of your planar travels.

**Skill Proficiencies:** Arcana, Survival

**Languages:** Two of your choice (*You never know who you'll run into in the 'verse.*)

**Equipment:** A sharp knife, blindfold, wax earplugs, sturdy boots,  a journal, a trinket that serves as key to an oft frequented portal, a set of traveler's clothes, and a belt pouch containing 25 gp (*you need coin for bribes*).

**Feature: You *Can* Get There From Here**

This isn't your first time in the multiverse. When you are on a plane you've previously traveled, you have an intuitive sense for finding your way back to a portal you've used. Your Dungeon Master will determine how long it takes to get there and where the portal leads.

**Suggested Characteristics**

A planewalker is shaped by her broad and otherworldly experiences. The planes she's visited and the planar denizens she's met make up her perspective on the multiverse. These experiences may make her bewildered, optimistic, cocky, or even jaded. If she belongs to a faction, she may adopt its philosophy to make some sense of things.

**d8 Personality Trait**

1. I've seen a lot in the multiverse. Did I ever tell you the time when ...?
2. If traveling the multiverse has taught me anything, it's don't stay in one place too long.
3. Everybody's playing the game, I like to know what they're playing for.
4. The meaning of life? Yeah, I know it. It ain't as profound as you think.
5. Gossip and rumors are as good as the truth around here. What've you heard?
6. The multiverse is infinite. So I always ask what's next.
7. I've learned to live in the present. The next portal may be my last.
8. The multiverse is beautiful and terrible. I am always in awe of its wonders.

**d6 Ideal**

1. **Compassion.** There are a lot of lost souls in the multiverse---alive, dead, and otherwise. I'll help them if I can. (Good)
2. **Rules.** Without rules the multiverse falls apart. You follow them, or you find the loopholes. (Lawful)
3. **Imagination.** If you can imagine it, it's in the multiverse; let's find it. (Chaotic)
4. **Ego.** I take what's mine, and that includes whatever I can get. (Evil)
5. **To each, her own.** I take care of myself. Everybody's business is her own. (Neutral)
6. **Factioneer.**  I belong to one of the factions in Sigil. Let me explain our philosophy.... (Any)

**d6 Bond**

1. I am trying to find the portal that will bring me home.
2. I made a deal with a devil that I can't keep.
3. I owe my wits to a mentor, whose expertise kept me alive more than once.
4. I left something important behind on another plane. I have to get back there to find it.
5. I have learned a secret of the multiverse. It must remain a secret.
6. My faction's philosophy is the truth, and I'm willing to die for it.

**d6 Flaw**

1. I exaggerate my expertise.
2. Life walking the planes left me jaded.
3. People who can't keep up with me I leave behind.
4. I find the meaning of the multiverse at the bottom of a mug.
5. I can't help but swindle a clueless prime; they're easy marks.
6. I don't think twice about taking a bribe to look the other way.
