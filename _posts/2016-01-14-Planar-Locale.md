*This is a draft of a planar site I am working on for an adventure set on the great wheel.*

## Planar Sites

The planes are infinite, multifarious expanses. Maps don't really suit them. A **plane** refers to an entire dimension of existence as a whole, such as the Nine Hells. Planes may also comprise **layers**. Each layer, while entirely contained within a plane, is infinite itself and has its own unique features. Planes are populated by powerful entities. **Realms** are the home domain of these deities and powers. Finally, planar **sites** are particular locations of interest in a plane, either because the site has significant power or meaning or for another reason. [1]  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;**_Further reading._** If planar adventures intrigue you, read Appendix C of the *PHB* and chapter 2 of the *DMG*. See also the *Planescape* setting, available at [dmsguild.com](http://www.dmsguild.com/browse.php?filters=0_44712_0).

### Goruphat's Pleasure Dome; or, The Factory

Gorphat's Pleasure Dome, the Factory, or sometimes simply *the Fact* is a metonym for an entire intraplanar region. The Fact appears as a sooty cloud of smog hanging in the polluted air of the great wheel of the outer planes. Within this cloud is a magically sustained spatiotemporal dimension. Entities and objects outside of this immense cloud pass through it like any ordinary fog, smoke, or mist, but within is an ever expanding neighborhood under the rule of the mysterious entity, Goruphat.

#### The Pleasure Dome and Palace

The principal place of interest in the Fact is Goruphat's pleasure dome and palace. Here Goruphat himself holds court over a seventy-seven floor casino. The games on the ground floor would be familiar to many a prime material plane denizen, but as one ascends the games become riskier, otherworldly, and in some cases even grotesque. Beneath the pleasure dome are countless foundries, assembly lines, and industries of every variety, from which the region gets its name. The Fact's workers are all paying back debts owed to region's mysterious sovereign. Few debtors ever return from the Fact, and those who do ineluctably find themselves back in the sooty assembly lines soon enough.

#### Rumors and Mysteries

They say Faer√ªnian expats gather at **The Pipe and Piglet**, a public house, beer garden, and tenement in the Fact. The Pipe and Piglet is owned and operated by a Waterdhavian wizard named Timaeus and his talking pig Orison. The pub has been in the neighborhood as long as anyone can remember. Some say the pair are in hiding from fiends or worse. Others say they lost a close friend to the assembly lines. Still others say they are there to undermine whatever Goruphat constructs in the Fact; they may even hire adventurers to help. Of course, it may be they bought when the market was down, and they're waiting for property values to rise. Whatever the fact is, Torilites and planewalkers of all types are welcome here.

#### Getting Adventurers to the Fact

Physical entry into the Fact requires assuming gaseous form before merging with the smog cloud exterior of the site. This is straightforward but impractical. Most of its inhabitants enter accidentally. Portals exist across the multiverse in the archways of churches, temples, hospitals, hospices, pubs, and taverns---whereever there is either hope or despair. An oath expressing hope or despair functions as the portal key.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unstable conduits from the quasielemental plane of ash appear and disappear along the limit of the interior of the domain, but these are more likely exits than points of entry. [2]
