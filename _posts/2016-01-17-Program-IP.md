##The Dungeon Masters Guild and Intellectual Property

I [tweeted](https://www.twitter.com/1morespacerhino) about the recent change to the Community Content Agreement (CCA) on the Dungeon Masters Guild\[\*\]. Some had asked me about it. Here's an informal layman's reading.

_**To be clear, I am not a lawyer. I don't hold myself out as one. This is not legal advice. Nevertheless, I do my best to understand the contents of the Community Content Agreement.**_

###Two Kinds of Intellectual Property in the CCA

According to the Dungeon Masters Guild Community Content Agreement, you have access to two kinds of intellectual property when creating original content for the DMs Guild:

1. **Wizards' IP.** D&D rules sets, parts of the campaign settings (*Forgotten Realms* only), and free artwork and templates that Wizards provides.

2. **Program IP.** User generated content from the DMs Guild. This includes, for example, original characters, scenes, locations and events from materials already available on DMs Guild.

In the launch version of the CCA it appeared that any copyrightable content in your work published on the DMs Guild became **Program IP**. This would mean that you were giving permission to other DMs Guild creators to make use of your work. Although you still own your original copyrightable work, by agreeing to the CCA you were giving permission for its use in the DMs Guild.

The updated version adds the following clarification (my boldface):

>...2... \(c\) “User Generated Content” shall be defined as the copyrightable elements included in your Work, such as original characters, scenes, locations and events. **User Generated content shall not include the illustrations and cartographic artwork included in your work.** Per the terms of this Agreement, you expressly agree that your User Generated Content, once submitted to the Program will become Program IP and useable by other members of the Program as well as the Owner as described in this Agreement....

>...8... \(c\) Excluding the Owner’s IP and Program IP which we license to you and **excluding the illustrations and cartographic artwork in your Work**, you are the sole owner of all rights in your Work. You have the rights or license to use the illustrations and cartographic artwork in your Work.

I gather that these mean that art and maps do not automatically become part of the **Program IP** and, consequently, it means other DMs Guild creators may **not** use art and maps they find in other DMs Guild works without appropriate permission. This assures artists and cartographers maintain control of their works. Characters, events, plots, etc., however, still are **Program IP**.

Finally, the [DMs Guild FAQ](https://www.dmsguild.com/whatisdmsguild.php) includes these helpful clarifications:

>**What kinds of artwork and maps can I use in my DMs Guild titles?**\
We updated the Community Content Agreement sections 2c and 8c to clarify the use of artwork. The artwork (illustrations and maps) that you include in your title do not become part of the DMs Guild content which other DMs Guild contributor can freely use. So generally speaking for these types of artwork.
**Art and Maps provided by Wizards of the Coast:**
The art you find in the Resources for DMs Guild Creators category are owned by Wizards and can be freely used in your DMs Guild titles.  
**Public Domain Art:** Art that you are certain is in the public domain can be used.  
**Stock Art:** Usage of stock art depends on the license associated with that stock art. Most of the stock art sold under the Publisher Resources category on DriveThruRPG includes a license that would allow it to be used in your DMs Guild titles.  
**Commissioned Art:** Usage of art that you commission from artist depends upon your terms with the artist. You must have the rights or license to use the art in your title. The artwork does not become owned by OneBookShelf or Wizards; you simply must have rights to use it in your commercial work.  
**Creative Commons:** This depends on the type of creative commons license. Some allow commerical use, others do not.

Again, I am not a lawyer. I don't hold myself out as one. This is not legal advice.

Best wishes, and happy creating.
