title: The Ascetic
---

*This is a draft of a new arcane tradition for the Wizard character class. Many of the archetypes in the* PHB *are more oriented around what they can do in combat, but most of my campaigns emphasize the social and exploration pillars. Here's a tradition, the ascetic, that emphasizes conviction, endurance, and concentration (in that order). The ascetic has affinities with the Monk class but is principally an arcane caster. Let's see whether it meets the metric from the* [Down with D&D][1] *podcast (\#50) at about 18:00.*

You train your body and your mind to ignore the illusions of this conventional world in order to attend to the simplicity and beauty of the world as it really is. Ascetics engage in rigorous discipline of the body and the intellectual exercises of philosophical debate and mindful meditation in order to hone their powers of concentration. Some ascetics are gadflies, philosophers of the street, who incessantly call out the hypocrisies of their society. Others are mystics seeking answers to the mysteries of the multiverse.

#### Masterful Memory ####
Nature has furnished you a limitless memory; what need have you for books?  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beginning when you select this tradition at 2nd level, when you prepare the list of wizard spells that are available for you to cast, you no longer require a spell book. Instead, you commit each spell to memory. Some ascetics use powerful memorization techniques so that their learning process is just as swift as their compatriots who use quill and ink.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Similarly, ascetics do not keep gold pieces or anything of conventional value. If a spell has a components worth more than 10 gp, an ascetic will have the components donated in exchange for an ascetic teaching.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Work with your Dungeon Master to determine an appropriate period of time for the memorization process and an appropriate exchange of ascetic teaching for the spell component.

#### Convincing Conversation ####
Starting at 2nd level, you gain proficiency in the Persuasion skill. When you converse with another entity, whose Intelligence score is 4 or greater and who can see and understand you, you may use an Intelligence check rather than Charisma check and you may use your Intelligence modifier on Persuasion skill checks.

#### Enlightened Endurance ####
Beginning at 6th level, you may use your Intelligence modifier rather than your Constitution modifier on checks and saving throws related to endurance (e.g., holding your breadth; going without sleep; surviving without food or water; or traveling through difficult terrain, in extreme weather or climates, or at high altitudes) and on checks to maintain concentration.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Additionally, your proficiency bonus is doubled for any ability check you make that uses the Persuasion skill.   

#### Philosophic Fortitude ####
At 10th level, you can use your action to end one effect on yourself that is causing you to be charmed or frightened.

#### No-Self ####
Starting at 14th level, when you cast a wizard spell that requires you to maintain concentration targeting yourself, you may target a second creature in addition to yourself without losing concentration. \[\*\]

### Notes ###
\[\*\] Wizard spells that require you to maintain concentration but whose only eligible target is yourself (e.g., *alter self* ) may now target one additional creature as if that creature were yourself.
