title: Travel Domain
---

*This is a draft of the Travel Domain for clerics, an archetype for the itinerant priest; the pilgrim; the traveling prophet(ess); and the messenger, harbinger, or bringer of good news*

The domain of travel values the journey, both physical and spiritual. While growth, development, maturation, and change are deeply valued, so too are endurance and perseverance. A person's life may be considered a test through which she must traverse with courage and stoic tranquility or an opportunity for metamorphosis into something new and different.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The travel domain also belongs to messengers of the gods like Hermes; gods of hospitality who welcome the stranger, such as Zeus Xenios; and gods who welcome the dead to their next life like Thoth.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Faer√ªn the god Shaundakul, the Rider of Winds, protects travelers, caravans, and wanderers, and his loosely connected priesthood maintains the many portals of that world.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sigil, the City of Doors, has several temples dedicated to the powers of travel, including Muamman Duathal the dwarf wanderer, Baravar Cloakshadow of the gnomes, Koriel of the ki-rin, Diancastra of the giants and titans, Zivlyn of Krynn, and Daragor the shape-shifter.\[\*\]
